# TIBCO-Messaging
The TIBCO Messaging Repo is where Messaging related source code is held for TIBCO's support of  Messaging software.

The TIBCO Messaging Repo is structured to be easily searchable for components and technologies.
Each repository held in the TIBCO Messaging Repo is structured such that the component is listed first and the
technology is listed second.  For example if you are looking for the eftl javascript sdk, you would find that
listed as eftl-javascript-sdk.

In addition you can find the TIBCO Messaging component samples under the samples repository.
The TIBCO-Messaging/samples repository is broken down into language binding/component setup.
So for example if you are looking for the c binding samples for ftl you would find them as samples/c/ftl/...
All the sample code and build instructions is maintained under this hierarchy.
