# TIBCO-Messaging
The TIBCO Messaigng Repo is where all Messaging related source code is held for TIBCO's support Messaging software.  TIBCO welcomes contribution and colberation on creating, maintaining and supporting all the open source components supplied in this repo.

The TIBCO-Messaging Repo is structured to be easily searchable for components and technologies.  Each repository held in the TIBCO Messaging Repo is structued such that the component is listed first and the technology is list second.  For example if you are looking for the eftl android sdk, you would find that listed as eftl-android-sdk.  If you are looking for the kafka ftl bridge, you would find that as kafka-ftl-bridge.  

In addition you can find all the TIBCO Messaging component samples under the samples repository.  The TIBCO-Messaging/samples repository is broken down into language binding/component setup.  So for example if you are looking for the c binding samples for ftl you would find them as samples/c/ftl/...  All the sample code and build instructions is maintained under this heirarchy.
