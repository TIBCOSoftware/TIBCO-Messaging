# TIBCO-Messaging
The Repository for TIBCO&reg; Messaging is where Messaging related source code is held for TIBCO's support of Messaging software.

The Repo for TIBCO&reg; Messaging is structured to be easily searchable for components and technologies.
Each repository in the Repo for TIBCO&reg; Messaging is structured such that the component is listed first and the
technology is listed second.  For example if you are looking for the TIBCO eFTL&trade; JavaScript SDK, you would find that
listed as eftl/sdk/javascript.

* NOTE all eftl/sdk directories provide both TIBCO eFTL and TIBCO Cloud&trade; Messaging development kits for
connecting applications to TIBCO eFTL or TIBCO Cloud Messaging. The eftl-golang-sdk directory is present for external references and is considered deprecated and will be removed in a future update.

In addition you can find the TIBCO&reg; Messaging component samples under the samples directory for the specific component.
The samples directory is further broken down into language binding.
So for example if you are looking for the C binding samples for TIBCO&reg; FTL you would find them as ftl/samples/c/...
