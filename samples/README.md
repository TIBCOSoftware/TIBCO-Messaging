$TIBCO-Messaging/samples

The TIBCO Messaigng Samples Repo is where all Messaging related sample/example code is held for TIBCO's support
Messaging software.  TIBCO welcomes contribution and collaboration on creating, maintaining and supporting any
samples/examples for any of the TIBCO Messaging solutions.

The repository is structured based on language binding.  All samples that have been generated for a given language
binding are found below that language by component name.  For example under golang you can find all golang
samples/examples for eFTL, EMS, FTL, Kafka, Mosquitto, and TCM.
